# Minishell

This project is about creating a shell called Minishell based on bash with a reduced set of rules.

Minishell should be able to parse commands (simple commands, pipes, redirections), execute them properly, handle environment variables, keep an history of the commands and of course handle all kind of errors and interruptions.
